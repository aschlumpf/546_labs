    "biography": "My name is Alex Schlumpf and I am a Junior Computer Science major at Stevens Institute of Technology. I grew up in central New Jersey in a town called Freehold Township. For the majority of my childhood I was a student-athlete, playing various sports including baseball, basketball football, and track and field. I became interested in technology and mathematics because of my grandfather's fascination with it, and also because I enjoy problem solving and critical thinking.\n I now spend a lot of time my with my friends, playing video games, discussing various topics on the Internet, and studying. I am a Course Assistant for CS284, which is a great opportunity for me to help out other students in understanding computer science topics and improve my own ability to discuss these topics. Last summer I worked as an intern at Colgate-Palmolive Company writing software for the eCommerce divison, and next summer I will be working at iCIMS.",
