        <h2>A Brief Biography</h2>
        <p> My name is Alex Schlumpf and I am a Junior
            Computer Science major at Stevens Institute of Technology. I grew up
            in central New Jersey in a town called Freehold Township. For the majority
            of my childhood I was a student-athlete, playing various sports including baseball, basketball
            football, and track and field. I became interested in technology and mathematics because of my
            grandfather's fascination with it, and also because I enjoy problem solving and critical thinking.
            I now spend a lot of time my with my friends, playing video games, discussing various topics on the
            Internet,
            and studying. I am a Course Assistant for CS284, which is a great opportunity for me to help out other
            students
            in understanding computer science topics and improve my own ability to discuss these topics. Last summer I
            worked
            as an intern at Colgate-Palmolive Company writing software for the eCommerce divison, and next summer I will
            be working
            at iCIMS.
